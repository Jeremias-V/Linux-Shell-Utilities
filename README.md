# Linux-Shell-Utilities
In this repository I explore shell scripting on Linux by coding scripts that can be quite useful for various things via Bash.


## [UVa-Local-Judge](https://github.com/Jeremias-V/Linux-Shell-Utilities/tree/master/UVa-Local-Judge)
This is a simple and small proyect where I try to simulate what https://onlinejudge.org/ does when one submits a source code file.
Might add more functionality later, for now it only works with C++11.
