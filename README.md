# Linux-Shell-Utilities
In this repository I explore shell scripting on Linux by creating scripts that can be quite useful for various things via Bash.


## [UVa-Local-Judge](https://github.com/Jeremias-V/Linux-Shell-Utilities/tree/master/UVa-Local-Judge)
This is a simple and small proyect where I try to simulate what https://onlinejudge.org/ does when one submits a source code file.
Might add more functionality later, for now it only works with C++11.

## [uDebug-Utils](https://github.com/Jeremias-V/Linux-Shell-Utilities/tree/master/uDebug-Utils)
Here you can find a script that opens the page to the given UVa ID at https://www.udebug.com/UVa with your default web browser. 

## [Bluetooth-Connect](https://github.com/Jeremias-V/Linux-Shell-Utilities/tree/master/Bluetooth-Connect)
A simple script to connect to previously paired devices using `bluetoothctl`. This script shows intuitive error messages and loading dots when waiting a process.
